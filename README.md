# Class-projects
This repository contins a few projects in data analysis using MATLAB. 

## Projects
In MATLAB, the projects are geared towards interpreting and drawing conclusions about large data sets, specifically with a COVID 19 data set.

### **[K-means classiying:](https://github.com/rfandozzi/MATLAB-projects/tree/rfandozzi-k-means)** A case study aimed at successully clustering COVID data into different locations in order to predict the origin of the data.

### **[Dynamic systems modeling:](https://github.com/rfandozzi/MATLAB-projects/tree/rfandozzi-dynamic-systems-modeling)** This project uses the SIRD (succeptable-infectied-recovered-dead) model to simulate the spread of COVID-19. The goal was to tune model parameters and simulate real-world scenarios based on historical data.
